## Blog App

This is an application that renders a list of blog posts on the screen. 

### `App Set-Up`
The app makes use of the redux library(redux), react-redux, axios and redux-thunk.

### `Design`
There are two main components PostList and UserHeader. 
The Postlist renders the entire list of blog posts while the UserHeader renders the author name.
The list consist of the title, the body or content, the name of the author and a simple icon on the left hand side.


### `How it Works`

The app uses Axios to make requests to a free public service called the Jsonplaceholder API. The response is the displayed in the right format on the screen.
